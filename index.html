        Ways you can directly make a change:
</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>Drive a fuel-efficient vehicle such as hybrids and fully electric vehicles, to save fuel and money.</li> 
            <li>Turn off lights and appliances when you donâ€™t need them because this will help you use less energy, cutting your carbon footprint</li>
            <li>Change lightbulbs to LEDs. Quality LED lightbulbs can last 25 times longer, are more durable, and use at least 75 percent less energy than other bulbs.</li>
        </ul>
